## ፁ System Architecture

1.  **Preprocessing Layer**: Real-time image acquisition → Grayscale Conversion → Bitwise Inversion → Resizing (28x28 pixels) → Normalization ([0,1]).
2.  **Model Layer**: Sequential CNN (Conv2D → MaxPool → Conv2D → MaxPool → Dense → Softmax).
3.  **Deployment Layer**: Served via Streamlit Community Cloud with CI/CD integration.

## ፁ Technical Features

- **Robust Inference Engine**: Powered by a CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset, achieving a validation accuracy of **~98%**.
- **Interactive UX**: Custom-built drawing canvas using `streamlit-drawable-canvas` for fluid user interaction.
- **Optimized Performance**: Singleton model loading using `@st.cache_resource` to minimize memory overhead and latency.
