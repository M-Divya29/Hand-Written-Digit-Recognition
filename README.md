# ፁ Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

Hi there! ፁ This is my first Deep Learning project where I built an app that can recognize numbers you draw on the screen!

ጐ **Try my app here:** [Live Demo Link](https://hand-written-digit-recognition-fdgurtwllfe6lizudj6eip.streamlit.app/)

---

## ፁ What does this app do?
This is a simple and fun web app. You draw any number from **0 to 9** on a digital canvas, and my AI model will guess which number it is in real-time!

## ፁ How I built it
1.  **Dataset**: I used the famous MNIST dataset (70,000 images of handwritten numbers).
2.  **Model**: I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow and Keras.
3.  **Web App**: I used **Streamlit** to create the user interface and the drawing canvas.
4.  **Deployment**: I hosted the app on Streamlit Cloud so anyone can use it!

## ፂ Tech Stack I Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (For the AI Model)
- **Streamlit** (For the Web Interface)
- **OpenCV** (To process the drawings)
- **NumPy** (For math operations)

## ፃ How to run it on your computer
If you want to try this code on your own machine, follow these easy steps:

1.  **Clone this folder**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/M-Divya29/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition.git
    ```
2.  **Install the needed libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Start the app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
